# Image-Processing
In this Repository I tried to apply the studied algorithm of IMAGE PROCESSING.
In this I have used OPENCV and NUMPY modules of python.
The program reads the Image via opencv and applies the KERNEL function matrix with the help of numpy and opencv, providing necessary depth and for rendering.
Atlast isplaying the original image and contaminated (filter applied) image.
